TL;DR: _The bug bash has been a massive success: all the tickets have been triaged at least once, almost 80 were closed, with 16 Pull Requests sent to fix or enhance CocoaPods. The result? CocoaPods 0.31!_

##The CocoaPods Bug Bash

```
  4 meetups world wide, 
  33 people, 
  16 pull requests, 
  6  claimed issues still being worked on, 
  86 issues confirmed as existing, 
  55 closed issues, and a total of 428 triage actions by participants.
```

We managed to raise the number of participants in the [CocoaPods dev tools](http://cocoapods.org/about) to over 170 contributors. With the top contributor [Neonichu](https://github.com/neonichu) submitting 9 PRs, and still finding time to contribute to other projects during the weekend. Mind-blowing.

## Things new to CocoaPods

* [Laurent Sansonetti](https://github.com/lrz) Ordered the output of pods correctly when versions went over two digits in the `pod spec` commands.

* [Richard Lee](https://github.com/dlackty) made linter checks if your homepage works so you won't accidentally link to the wrong place, on top of that he made sure that when running `pod install` on Travis CI it runs with the right shell encoding.
  
* [Robert Zuber](https://github.com/z00b) wrapped up [Stefan Damm](https://github.com/StefanDamm)'s PR to include the versions of the Pods to the output of `pod list`.
  
* [Marc Boquet](https://github.com/apalancat) Unset the `CDPATH` env variable before shelling-out to `prepare_command`.


## The most important fix


* Resolve crash related to the I18n deprecation warning.
