TL;DR: _CocoaPods 0.31 is a big community effort!_

<!-- more -->

## Features from the CocoaPods Bug Bash

The [CocoaPods Dev team](http://cocoapods.org/about) is knackered after the bug bash, we managed to get a lot more contributors to CocoaPods squashed a lot of bugs and triaged a tonne of tickets. 

So rather than trying to get started on the next big feature (build configuration dependant pods, I hear.) Fabio opted for making a community release first. No big features, but a lot of thanks. Anyone who contributed is now in the commiters section in the lower half of the [About page](http://cocoapods.org/about).

## Things new to CocoaPods

* [Laurent Sansonetti](https://github.com/lrz) Ordered the output of pods correctly when versions went over two digits in the `pod spec` commands.

* [Richard Lee](https://github.com/dlackty) made linter checks if your homepage works so you won't accidentally link to the wrong place, on top of that he made sure that when running `pod install` on Travis CI it runs with the right shell encoding.
  
* [Robert Zuber](https://github.com/z00b) wrapped up [Stefan Damm](https://github.com/StefanDamm)'s PR to include the versions of the Pods to the output of `pod list`.
  
* [Marc Boquet](https://github.com/apalancat) Unset the `CDPATH` env variable before shelling-out to `prepare_command`.
