[Orta](https://twitter.com/orta) has been kind enough to organise yet another
Cocoa Kucha. This time he's pulled together an awesome collection of talented
people based in San Francisco, along with a couple of visitors down for WWDC.
Cocoa Kucha 4 is generously hosted by [HipByte](http://www.hipbyte.com) after
their RubyMotion [#inspect conference](http://www.rubymotion.com/conference/2014/),
which is just days before WWDC kicks-off.

Like with the other Kuchas, this meetup is in the style of [Pecha
Kucha](http://www.pechakucha.org/faq) where there are 8 speakers doing short
talks related to Objective-C for 6 minutes and 20 seconds. The speaker must go
though 20 slides, 20 seconds per slide. This keeps them to the point and makes
it a lot easier for people to get started.

### Speakers

I'm excited to share the list of speakers, which includes four members of the
Cocoa Pods dev team:
