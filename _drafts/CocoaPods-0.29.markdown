TL;DR: _CocoaPods 0.29 introduces the pod try subcommand, the social media URL
podspec attribute & complete inhibition of header warnings._

Every now and then we hear about tiny yet huge feature requests for CocoaPods.
Pod try is one of these. Suggested by [Laurent Sansonetti], pod try quickly
gained a spot among the features of CocoaPods that I love the most. But…
What is it?

## Pod Try

Pod try is a new subcommand which allows you to quickly launch the demo project
of a Pod. It can be used to assess the quality of a library – very useful for
user interface elements – or to quickly get up to speed on how to use it.

In other words the command automates the following steps:

1. Checkout the source of the Pod in a temporary directory.
- Search for any project looking like a demo project using some simple heuristics.
- Install any CocoaPods dependencies if needed by the located project.
- Open the workspace/project in Xcode.

To check it out just update to the last release of CocoaPods and run:

```
$ pod try LMAlertView
```

## Social Media URL

As you might know, the [@CocoaPodsFeed] account posts notifications about new
Pods. We have been aware from a long time that some users replied to those
tweets and that the conversation, as the tweets are generated by an automatic
service, was unfortunately lost. When [@user] suggested to include the Twitter
handle of the author of the Pod we decided to take action.

Identifying a solution was not easy because on the one hand we didn't want to
include a DSL attribute dedicated to a proprietary platform like Twitter; on
the other hand, we recognized that Twitter was a very convenient channel for
discussing Open Source Projects. After discussing for 75 minutes we managed to
come up with a solution which was able to satisfy our requirements:
the social media URL. Instead of asking to specify a Twitter handle we opted to
ask for an URL.

[@user]: www.example.com
[@CocoaPodsFeed]: https://twitter.com/CocoaPodsFeed

```ruby
spec.social_media_url = 'https://twitter.com/cocoapods'
```

When we generate the Tweet for a new Pod we just check if the social media URL
includes the `twitter.com` domain and in that case we include the handle in the
tweet (shortening the description of the Pod if needed). We expect this feature
to improve the visibility of Pods authors and increase the engagement with
their libraries. The result is the following:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden" lang="en"><p>[MPMoviePlayerController-Subtitles] Easy way to show SRT files on MPMoviePlayerController <a href="https://t.co/SWyuNTyRkF">https://t.co/SWyuNTyRkF</a></p>&mdash; CocoaPods New Pods (@CocoaPodsFeed) <a href="https://twitter.com/CocoaPodsFeed/statuses/408303077691629568">December 4, 2013</a></blockquote>

## Header warnings

Another great feature in this release is the ability to completely silence
header warnings.

This feature was contributed by the new core team member [swizzlr]

## Bug fixes

Bug fixes might not be the best argument to read about – unless they are
affecting you – but definitely are the foundation of solid software. Luckily
we got our bases covered thanks to [Joshua Kalpin] who appears to be on a
streak!  Among the many fixes the one related to the `pod lib lint` subcommand
deserves a quick mention.

## Updating

To install the last release of CocoaPods you can run:

```
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
```

Until version 1.0 we strongly encourage you to keep CocoaPods up to date.

[Changelog](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
