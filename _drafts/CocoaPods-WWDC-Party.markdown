CocoaPods is a dependency manager for Objective-C, it makes it very easy for people to use open source code or to share code between multiple apps elegantly. It's become an annual tradition now for CocoaPods to host [an event](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/cocoapods-2nd-annual-wwdc-meetup-tickets-6887230893) at WWDC, we want to make this another great one.

There will be a keynote by [Orta Therox](http://orta.github.io) with both [Eloy Durán](https://twitter.com/alloy) and [Fabio Pelosin](https://twitter.com/fabiopelosin‎) skyping in to assist. We will go through some of the large changes that are happening behind the scenes in CocoaPods, show-off some new things and talk about future plans.

We will also have a large contingent of the CocoaPods dev team giving some talks on some of the work they've been doing around the community.
