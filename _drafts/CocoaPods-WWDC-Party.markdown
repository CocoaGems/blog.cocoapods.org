Apple have their developers state of the union address. We have ours. We're working with the [Alt Conference](http://www.altconf.com) to have a great opening event to the WWDC week: The CocoaPodsAlt State of the Union. You should come along.

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Objective-C, it makes it very easy for people to use open source code or to share code between multiple apps elegantly. It's become an annual tradition now for CocoaPods to host [an event](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/cocoapods-2nd-annual-wwdc-meetup-tickets-6887230893) at WWDC, we want to make this another great one.

There will be a keynote by [Orta Therox](http://orta.github.io) with both [Eloy Durán](https://twitter.com/alloy) and [Fabio Pelosin](https://twitter.com/fabiopelosin‎) skyping in to assist. We will go through some of the large changes that are happening behind the scenes in CocoaPods, show-off some new things and talk about future plans.

We will also have a large contingent of the CocoaPods dev team giving some talks on some of the work they've been doing around the community:

* [Boris Bügling](http://buegling.com) - On learning Ruby by [contributing](https://github.com/CocoaPods/Core/commits?author=neonichu) [to](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/commits?author=neonichu) CocoaPods.
* [Marin Usalj](http://supermar.in) - 
* [Michele Titolo](http://michele.io) - On Private Pods
* [Kyle Fuller](http://kylefuller.co.uk) - Creating your first CocoaPod

We were planning on hosting it at 7:00pm and should be over by around 10:00pm, this should give everyone chance to then move on to some of the late night parties that will be happening around San Francisco.
The meetup will be hosted at the [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) offices, who are just a short walk away from the Moscone Center. They will be graciously providing both food & beer.
