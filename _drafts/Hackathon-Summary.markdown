Last Saturday was the [first CocoaPods hackathon][1], and about 15 developers showed up, despite post-WWDC tiredness.

Most projects stayed true to the [Pod Roulette][2] theme which assigned each team three random Pods which needed to be used in their project. Adding additional Pods was allowed, but you had to use each randomly assigned Pod in some fashion.

Below is a list of what was presented:

- **StickyHeaderFlowLayoutFiltersSortDescriptorWilsonRank**, dubbed the *Instagram of beatboxing* by [@topwobble][5] and team. [Source on GitHub][3] and [Audio Snippet][4].

- **PullToRefreshPopperToolsImageDownloader**, an [Imgur][6] Roulette app by [@alexdaukrainian][7] and team. [Source on GitHub][8] and [Video][9].

- **InterfaCSSStatusBarBlurryTableViewController**, a MultiPeerConnectivity enabled app by [@orta][10] and team. [Source on GitHub][11]. Orta also worked on two iOS 8 keyboards, a very useful Hodor one and one for quick access to animated GIFs.

- **GtmHttpFetcherCoreLinkCocoa**, an app for remote controlling a [PJLink-enabled][12] projector with your Pebble by [@hbehrens][13] and team. Source will be available after cleanup.

Apart from those fun projects, we even got some useful stuff as well:

- [@simjp][14] worked on [jazzy][15], a better way to generate documentation using *SourceKit*.

- [@blakewatters][16] released [FMDBMigrationManager][17], a library for managing SQLite database schemas with FMDB.


There's also a timelapse video of the whole event:

Thanks a lot to [Layer][18] for hosting the event and graciously providing food and drinks!
