We are very glad to announce that [SoundCloud] will be partnering with the [Travis Foundation] to sponsor the developer of CocoaPods.

In the words of SoundCloud's [OSS]  Erik: 

> Our iOS team uses CocoaPods every day to manage the dependencies of our mobile apps. We hope that will lead to to improvements that benefit the entire Mac and iOS developer ecosystem.

WE are doing 3 months and the plan is to release a major feature every month...
