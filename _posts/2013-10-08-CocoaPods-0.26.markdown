Today we are releasing CocoaPods 0.26.

The most visible change is that CocoaPods now hides the schemes of the Pod
targets. If this doesn't ring a bell the following image should.

<!-- more -->

Don't fear though, the schemes are still there and if you need to check that a
CocoaPods generated target is behaving correctly you can easily make its
scheme visible.

Other improvements include the restoration of the compatibility with Xcode 4
which was creating issues in our linting process and the reorganization of the
Pods project.

This release also features a contribution from the latest entry to our core
team: [Kyle Fuller](https://twitter.com/kylefuller)

To install the last release of CocoaPods you can run:

```
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
```

Until version 1.0 we strongly encourage you to keep CocoaPods up to date.
