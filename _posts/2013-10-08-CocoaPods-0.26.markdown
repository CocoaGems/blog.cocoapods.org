Today we are releasing CocoaPods 0.26.

<!-- more -->

The most visible change is that now CocoaPods hides the schemes of the Pod
targets. If this doesn't ring a bell the following image should.

Don't fear though the scheme are there and if you need to check that a target
generated by CocoaPods is being generated correctly you can easily make it
visible.

Other improvements include the restoration the compatibility with Xcode 4 which
was creating issues in our linting process and the reorganization of the Pods
project.

This release also features a contribution from the last entry in our Core team:

To install the last release of CocoaPods you can run:

```
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
```

Until version 1.0 we strongly encourage you to keep CocoaPods up to date.
