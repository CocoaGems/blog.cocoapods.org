TL;DR: _New library notifications have moved from the [@CocoaPods](http://twitter.com/CocoaPods) twitter to the [@CocoaPodsFeed](http://twitter.com/CocoaPodsFeed) twitter account_

If you want to follow the new libraries on CocoaPods, <a href="https://twitter.com/CocoaPodsFeed" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false" data-lang="en">Follow @CocoaPodsFeed</a>

<!-- more -->

In thinking about ways that CocoaPods can communicate news, updates and ideas one of the first things that came out in discussion was _"Let's make the Twitter more relevant."_ 

Right now if you want to keep up to date with CocoaPods you also end up keeping up to date with every new library on the platform. This can be too much sometimes, especially for people who don't follow hundreds of people.

To deal with this effectively we've moved out notifications on to a separate twitter account allowing the CocoaPods twitter feed to become a relatively low-chaff high information yield source for those interested in keeping up on Objective-C Open Source.
