One should avoid repeating oneself. New York City is where we started running [Cocoa Kuchas](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Cocoa-Kucha/) last year and whilst there's a lot more stories to tell here it's time to move on. 

This month we will be hosting a panel on iOS Testing. Find out more inside.

The Komittee is an event where we will take people with strong opinions, and get them started on a contentious topic and see if we can learn something from the process. Testing in general is a hot topic. Mix that with a tight platform, closed tools and you've got a lot of flames.

## Details

We are graciously being hosted by Spotify, at their [NYC HQ](https://www.google.com/maps/preview/place/Spotify+USA/@40.7420096,-74.0000379,16z/data=!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sSpotify+USA,+West+18th+Street,+New+York,+NY!3m1!1s0x0:0x8dc308c2ad65f154) on the 25th of February at 7pm.

## Topics

* QA vs Automated Unit testing
* Testing units of code vs Testing behavior
* Obj-C implementation strategies vs other ecosystems
* Time management
* Ways to improve testing for everyone
