TL;DR: _CocoaPod 0.32 is here! It brings an up-to-date and updated `update`
command and a galore of improvements._

<!-- more -->


## Update Command Improvements

[Marius Rackwitz](https://twitter.com/mrackwitz) just added one of the most
requested CocoaPods features:

```
pod repo update NAME
```

Exactly. Now you can scope your update to _only one_ Pod.

This is not the only improvement to the update command, as [Andrea
Mazzini](https://github.com/andreamazz) also took care of polishing the
experience by adding to the installation output the version from which a Pod is
being updated.

## Development Pods

Now the file references in Xcode are absolute or relative depending on how they
where specified in the Podfile. This feature was implemented by [Samuel
Ford](https://github.com/samuelwford)

## Deprecations

Another feature that had a lot of requests is support for Pod deprecation.
Thanks to the work of [Paul Young](https://github.com/paulyoung) this feature
is already supported at the DSL level.

You can either specify whether a Pod is just deprecated:

```
spec.deprecated = true
```

Or whether it has been deprecated _in favor of another_ Pod:

```
spec.deprecated_in_favor_of = 'NewMoreAwesomePod'
```

Unfortunately CocoaPods doesn’t display this information yet, but the super
prolific [Samuel E. Giddins](https://github.com/segiddins) is [already at
it](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/pull/2044).

## Linter

The linter has seen a lot of activity and now is more aggressive than ever.
Expect some great linting on the new Pods. Now it even checks the validity of
screenshots.

## feeds.cocoapods.org

Feeds.cocoapods.org has been revamped!

## Updating

To install the last release of CocoaPods you can run:

```
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
```

Until version 1.0 we strongly encourage you to keep CocoaPods up-to-date.

For all the details, don’t miss the
[Changelog](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
