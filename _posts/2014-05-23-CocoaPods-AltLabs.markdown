It's been a busy week, with the introduction of Trunk and CocoaPods 0.33.
We're delighted to announce another event in San Francisco, this time it's
[AltLabs](http://www.altconf.com/altlabs/), a labs session dedicated to
CocoaPods. Special thanks goes to [AltConf](http://www.altconf.com/) for
hosting the session.

<!-- more -->

The labs session will give you a perfect opportunity to come along and meet
some of the team behind CocoaPods. We will be able to assist you on any issues
you have with CocoaPods along with migrating your pods to the brand new trunk
system. Our session will also allow you to get help setting up a development
environment and making your first contribution to CocoaPods.

Since we have a lot going on during WWDC, I'm going to take this opportunity to
give you a quick reminder of all the events we are hosting so you don't miss out:

- [Cocoa Kucha 4 (28th May 2014)](/Cocoa-Kucha-4/)
- [The CocoaPodsAlt State of the Union (2nd June 2014)](/CocoaPods-WWDC-Party/)
- CocoaPods Labs (5th June 2014, 9am - noon)

The session will be hosted at Jillian's which is right across the street from
both AltConf and Moscone West. So you have absolutely no excuse not to pop
over if you are in San Francisco for either events.
