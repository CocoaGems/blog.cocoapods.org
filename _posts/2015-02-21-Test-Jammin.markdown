Last year, around this time, we ran a [Bug Bash][1] over a weekend. It went beautifully. We triaged a whole lot of issues, got a lot of minor issues fixed and found some new members for the core team.

Not ones to repeat ourselves, weâ€™ve begun preparations on the next big community event. Itâ€™s a test jam, and everyone is invited.

*TLDR/Elevator Pitch*: If the community is going to move towards Swift, then letâ€™s make sure that our Objective-C is in order by adding tests to established libraries.

Find out more below.

Date: April 18th + 19th 2015
Locations: NYC / SF / + More

We have picked out 200 pods without tests, or with very low test coverage, ordered by [popularity][2]. These are assigned randomly to interested contributors. They then will aim to:

* Add tests to the library.
* Add [Travis CI][3].
* Add [Coveralls Support][4].
* Submit a Pull Request to the original repo.

We will be operating a chat room with a lot of high high profile names in Cocoa testing over the weekend offering advice. So if testing is new to you, it may be a perfect time to start.

Which tool each contributor chooses to write tests is up to the owner of a library. This isnâ€™t about wrestling control from them, but supporting the project. They could prefer [XCTest][5], [Specta][6] / [Expecta][7] , [Kiwi][8] or [Cedar][9]. Each project will, ideally, have an issue stating this upfront. If not, itâ€™s up to the contributor to decide.

Weâ€™re planning on emailing all authors soon offering the chance to opt-out or to advise on how to communicate a projectâ€™s testing intentions. 

Finally weâ€™ll likely be having office space in [NYC (Artsy HQ)][10], SF and more (feel free to [email us][12] if you want to do one in your city.) So you can sit with fellow testers, discuss difficulties and share triumphs.
