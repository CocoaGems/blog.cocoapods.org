TL;DR: _CocoaPods 0.37_ has been released, with a new pod download cache and support for custom module maps.

CocoaPods 0.37 has been released, it includes download caching for Pods.
This brings a huge speed improvement to commands such as `pod spec lint`
and improves the performance of running `pod install` when a Pod is in
the download cache
(which is stored at `~/Library/Caches/CocoaPods/Pods` by default).

The update also allows you to define a custom
[module map](https://guides.cocoapods.org/syntax/podspec.html#module_map)
file in a Podspec.

Along with these enhancements, 0.37 features dozens of bug fixes.

## Updating

To install the last release of CocoaPods you can run:

```bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
```

Until version 1.0 we strongly encourage you to keep CocoaPods up-to-date.

For all the details, donâ€™t miss the
[Changelog](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/0.37.0/CHANGELOG.md)!
