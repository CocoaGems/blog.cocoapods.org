Apple have their developers state of the union address. We have ours. We're working with the [Alt Conference](http://www.altconf.com) to have a great opening event to the WWDC week: The CocoaPods-Alt State of the Union. You should come along.

<!-- more -->

It's become an annual tradition for CocoaPods to host [an](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/cocoapods-2nd-annual-wwdc-meetup-tickets-6887230893) [event](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-WWDC-Party) at WWDC,
and we want to make this another great one.
Last year we ended up with a waiting list almost double the amount we could get in, so we're pulling a leaf out of Apple's book by holding a [lottery](https://sotu.cocoapods.org).

We've got it set up to favour those who have contributed to the core CocoaPods repos, but registration is open to everyone with a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account. [Twilio](https://citymapper.com/go/6jm7vo) have graciously offered to host us again this year, June Eighth (Monday) at 6:30 PM, and we can't wait to see you all!

All of the details, as well as the lottery registration link, are available at [https://sotu.cocoapods.org/](https://sotu.cocoapods.org/). We'll be closing the lottery and announcing the lucky entrants on Thursday, so hurry up and register!
