During the summer 2015 we had the amazing opportunity to contribute to CocoaPods while being funded by Rails Girls Summer of Code (RGSoC), as well as being hosted and coached by GitHub. How did this work?

## What is Rails Girls Summer of Code?

At the time of applying for the fellowship program we were considering a number of great but also costly bootcamps in San Francisco. This alternative to a bootcamps or internship, if you like, works a little different. It is much up to the fellows to design their own program by firstly find a fellow teammate, finding an open source project to work on as well as coaches, mentors and workspace. RGSoC have been around for three years aiming to bring more diversity into Open Source. During this Summer 16 teams were sponsored globally.

## How we met the team
We officially met the CocoaPods team the weekend right before Alt-Conf at Limon, a Peruvian restaurant. When Kyle Fuller had mentioned a dinner party, I totally thought we were dining at someone’s house. Yet, he had arranged for a surprising dinner party at Limon in the Mission.The CocoaPods team took up nearly the entire second floor. It was scary at first to go meet 14 different people that might already know each other.To ease the anxiety I remembered that we had already met Kyle Fuller and Samuel Giddins at a cafe in SOMA, and they were pretty friendly. At Limon, we introduced each other, one at a time, and listened to conversations around us. We learned a bit more about dependency managers through conversational CocoaPods. Hearing terms drop when we had only a faint idea what they meant was no deterrent, it was fuel to the curiosity fire. After dinner we walked around the Mission and ended up at an ice cream shop with more vanilla flavors than usually offered. The week we met the CocoaPods team was also the same week we met many iOS developers here in San Francisco for AltConf.


## How we organized the work

The student teacher ratio were pretty much reversed from what a learning environment usually looks like. Us two fellows had 11 dedicated mentors who were willing to spend time to help us throughout the project. Most collaboration with our mentors happened remotely and many of our team members were based in other countries and timezones than our self. Communication often started in one of the three Slack channels from the organizations involved in the project. Longer sessions and pairing were planned in advance.

To schedule sessions with mentors and coaches located in different time zones, we used a combination of Google Calendar, Slack, and texts. For screen sharing, we found ScreenHero, Google Hangouts, Blue Jeans, and Skype to be our go to’s. Having screen sharing alternatives was necessary since audio, and screen sharing delays are unavoidable.
Being flexible with unpredictable events is really the key to success. Not getting enough sleep, double scheduling, conferences, and the cold all happened. Communicating with as much time in advance when something changes and you can’t make it is the best way to show respectful of each others schedule. Using the calendar religiously and setting alerts to avoid forgetting scheduled sessions and due dates was also very useful.

## Conclusion

We encourage other open source projects to be a part of next years RGSoC.
