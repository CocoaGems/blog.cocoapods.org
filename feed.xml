      <title>CocoaPods Beta</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;em&gt;CocoaPods just got a facelift.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe design is important. CocoaPods is probably the most public facing Objective-C project. Applying design to open source projects is a sign of maturity, and of stability. Whilst we&amp;#39;re still not 1.0 yet, having a cohesive brand is a step towards that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post documents some of the work involved in making the new CocoaPods web properties.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CocoaPods 0.28</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;em&gt;CocoaPods 0.28 introduces support for plugins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting feature creep in CocoaPods is not easy. We hear about a lot of great
ideas and many of them don&amp;#39;t make the cut as they would not be useful for at
least 80% of our users. The ideal solution would be support for third-party
plugins and, luckily, an elegant and lean patch from &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.leshill.org&quot;&gt;Les Hill&lt;/a&gt; has introduced
it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CocoaPods 0.27 and improved installation UX</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;em&gt;Compilation as part of the CocoaPods gem install process is dead. Long
live precompiled gems!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CocoaPods gems will now be installable &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt;
the need for installing the Xcode Command Line Tools and fixing the Ruby
headers location on OS X (Mountain Lion &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Mavericks).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cocoa Kucha - 20 Nov 2013</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CocoaPods is more than just a tool, CocoaPods is a community of over a thousand &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;commiters&lt;/a&gt;, six thousand Podspecs and hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubygems.org/gems/cocoapods&quot;&gt;users&lt;/a&gt;. To say the community is growing is a mild &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/graphs/code-frequency&quot;&gt;understatement&lt;/a&gt;. One of the cool things about a big community is that there&amp;#39;s the chance that people will get clumped enough together to make meeting up and sharing ideas a possible. I&amp;#39;d like to announce our first attempt at trying to bring people together, starting in New York City this November.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CocoaPods 0.26</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we are releasing CocoaPods 0.26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most visible change is that CocoaPods now hides the schemes of the Pod
targets. If this doesn&amp;#39;t ring a bell the following image should.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Design</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CocoaPods is arguably one of the most important open source project in the Objective-C community. It&amp;#39;s used in thousands of applications and has hundreds of thousands of downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building the tool, the community and the ecosystem around the project has happened organically with a mix of people coming and helping out to get us to a position where CocoaPods is essential to any project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from May 2013, I&amp;#39;ve been working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://andy-myers.co.uk&quot;&gt;Andy Myers&lt;/a&gt; to try and re-think the systems around CocoaPods, ranging from how we do documentation to the branding. This blog post is to open up our process a bit and to explain how we came to some of these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why we don't accept donations</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: While we very much appreciate the sentiment, the project (as an entity) does not accept financial donations. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Using Acknowledgements</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CocoaPods will generate two &amp;#39;Acknowledgements&amp;#39; files for each target specified in your Podfile. If the pods are coming from the master repo, then they must include one. Private pods don&amp;#39;t require one. These contain the License details for each Pod and for most of the part having them in your acknowledgements will be enough to conform to the license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CocoaPods generates a markdown file for general consumption, as well as a property list file that can be added to a settings bundle for an iOS application. You don&amp;#39;t need to do anything for this to happen, it will just work. If you&amp;#39;d like to know more about extra things you can do with this, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
