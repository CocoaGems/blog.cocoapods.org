      <description>&lt;p&gt;Physical objects for abstract ephemeral work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working on tools is all about levels of abstraction. CocoaPods abstracts away the idea of dealing with the transmission, setup and installation of a Cocoa Library into just &lt;code&gt;pod &amp;quot;FDModel&amp;quot;&lt;/code&gt;. The bits and pieces behind the internals are just as abstracted away from CocoaPods through ruby gems like &lt;code&gt;Xcodeproj&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Molinillo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CLAide&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Devoting time to CocoaPods is not a thank-less task, those who have become known for their work on CocoaPods have vastly improved their &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/articles/business/the_bet/2014/05/klout_is_basically_dead_but_it_finally_matters.html&quot;&gt;Klout score&lt;/a&gt;. Being a person who has submitted two or three pull requests probably hasn&amp;#39;t though. We want to try and do something to say thanks in  a meaningful way. We opted for token of our gratitude in the form of a coin. We&amp;#39;ll be getting these sent out to the top 80 contributors to CocoaPods the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CocoaPods 0.34</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;em&gt;CocoaPods 0.34&lt;/em&gt; which includes the work sponsored by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://soundcloud.com&quot;&gt;SoundCloud&lt;/a&gt; has been released. The highlights? Support
for scoping Pods per build configuration, declaration of source repositories,
and faster downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This release will require making changes to your &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/artsy/eidolon/blob/master/Podfile#L1-L2&quot;&gt;Podfile&lt;/a&gt;s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>pod lib create v2</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pod lib create&lt;/code&gt; has been our way of trying to encourage standards, and to make it easy to create a new library. Before today it would leave a &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.dblock.org/reorganizing-cocoapod-folder-structure-for-unit-and-integration-testing&quot;&gt;lot of setup&lt;/a&gt; at the developer&amp;#39;s discretion. The new version automates a lot of common problems away and starts you with a new library structure. Read on for details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or just go straight to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.cocoapods.org/making/using-pod-lib-create.html&quot;&gt;Using Pod Lib Create guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pod Roulette Hackathon SF Summary</title>

      
      <description>&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B_iY-nlLiaNqdm16QTA5Nk9yTm8/preview&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;480&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last Saturday we ran the &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cocoapods.org/Pod-Roulette-Hackathon/&quot;&gt;first CocoaPods hackathon&lt;/a&gt; with a great turn out especially considering post-WWDC tiredness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ran it based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://podroulette.com&quot;&gt;Pod Roulette&lt;/a&gt;, and surprisingly most projects stayed true to the theme. We assigned each team three random Pods which needed to be used in their projects, adding additional Pods was fine, but you had to use each randomly assigned Pod in some fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Stripe's Open Source Retreat</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, I am beyond excited to announce that I will be working full-time on CocoaPods this autumn, courtesy of Stripe&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;https://stripe.com/blog/open-source-retreat-grantees&quot;&gt;Open Source Retreat&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For three months, in addition to my normal work on CocoaPods, I will be working to write a reference implementation of an iterative dependency resolver that will be shared by CocoaPods and &lt;a href=&quot;https://bundler.io/&quot;&gt;Bundler&lt;/a&gt; (and available to any developer that wants to use it).
As part of the project, I will also be writing a language-agnostic test suite to help standardize behavior across different implementations of resolvers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pod Roulette Hackathon - San Francisco - 7th June 2014</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of &lt;a href=&quot;http://podroulette.com&quot;&gt;pod-roulette&lt;/a&gt;? If not, here&amp;#39;s their elevator pitch:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just moved to the big city, got a seed investment but don&amp;#39;t have an idea what to do next?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pod Roulette will find three random pods and prepare a project for you in a few seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After seeing this project, we knew that there should be a &lt;strong&gt;hackathon&lt;/strong&gt; using this.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>On Launching<br />CocoaDocs Version 2</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In March 2013 I uploaded the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CocoaPods/cocoadocs.org/commit/93e9896b04f79eb09be28a9056671b1d23f3143d&quot;&gt;initial commit&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href=&quot;http://cocoadocs.org&quot;&gt;CocoaDocs&lt;/a&gt;. This action triggered a roller-coaster &lt;a href=&quot;http://orta.github.io/on/being/27/#cocoadocs&quot;&gt;year for me&lt;/a&gt;. I&amp;#39;m super excited to announce the second iteration of CocoaDocs is now running and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/ReactiveCocoa/2.3.1/&quot;&gt;parsing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/ARAnalytics/2.7.2/&quot;&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/BlocksKit/2.2.3/&quot;&gt;Docsets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CocoaPods AltLabs - San Francisco - 5th June 2014</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a busy week, with the introduction of Trunk and CocoaPods 0.33.
We&amp;#39;re delighted to announce another event in San Francisco, this time it&amp;#39;s
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.altconf.com/altlabs/&quot;&gt;AltLabs&lt;/a&gt;, a labs session dedicated to
CocoaPods. Special thanks goes to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.altconf.com/&quot;&gt;AltConf&lt;/a&gt; for

for our community… the support for CocoaPods Trunk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Claim Your Pods</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we are introducing the ‘Trunk’ web-service. An awesome new way for podspec
authors to submit their libraries to the master specs repository. For
authors who have previously had push access the workflow should be very
similar using the &lt;code&gt;pod push&lt;/code&gt; subcommand. For more information on the ‘Trunk’
web-service itself, see &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Trunk/&quot;&gt;the previous blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along with these changes we are adding a hierarchy of ownership to
submitted podspecs. This way library maintainers will have complete
control over submissions of their specs to the master repo.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cocoa Kucha 4 - San Francisco - 28th May 2014</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/orta&quot;&gt;Orta&lt;/a&gt; has been kind enough to organise yet another
Cocoa Kucha. This time he&amp;#39;s pulled together an awesome collection of talented
people based in San Francisco, along with a couple of visitors down for WWDC.
Cocoa Kucha 4 is generously hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hipbyte.com&quot;&gt;HipByte&lt;/a&gt; after
their RubyMotion &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rubymotion.com/conference/2014/&quot;&gt;#inspect conference&lt;/a&gt;,
which is just days before WWDC kicks-off.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>AppIe Acquires CocoaPods</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt; We hope you enjoyed our April Fools’ day prank! We are still an independent open-source project and fully committed to you, our users. In case it wasn’t completely clear to you, you &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; have thought that this post mentions a big well-known technology company, however, it in fact mentions ‘Appie’, which –with our sans-serif font– looks different when spelled with a capital ‘I’ ;) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AppieDuran/status/450975104395390976/photo/1&quot;&gt;Appie&lt;/a&gt; is Eloy’s dog, we are not sure whether or not this prank was planned years ahead…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big news, everybody! AppIe* has finally acquired CocoaPods.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;em&gt;The bug bash has been a massive success: all the tickets have been triaged at least once, almost 80 were closed, with 16 Pull Requests sent to fix or enhance CocoaPods. The result? CocoaPods 0.31!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In true Open Source style we looked at ways of getting people to help out cleaning out the GitHub issues. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then looked for interesting incentives, and we have some compelling icing on the proverbial cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are always looking for ways to make contributing to CocoaPods easier, and a quick win for us is auto-deploying the guides and blog. Now any member of the team can accept a PR, and Travis will deploy the changes within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One should avoid repeating oneself. New York City is where we started running &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.cocoapods.org/Cocoa-Kucha/&quot;&gt;Cocoa Kuchas&lt;/a&gt; last year and whilst there&amp;#39;s a lot more stories to tell here it&amp;#39;s time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month we will be hosting a panel on iOS Testing. Find out more inside.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Repairing Our Broken Specs Repository</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we&amp;#39;ve encountered a bug in libgit2 and we are going to have to
&lt;strong&gt;force push&lt;/strong&gt; into &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs&quot;&gt;the Specs repository&lt;/a&gt;. (Also known as the
‘master’ spec repo.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What does this mean for you?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, basically your CocoaPods setup &lt;strong&gt;is going to break&lt;/strong&gt;. You are going to
have to manually delete &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; local copies of the Specs repository and re-clone
the new version of the Specs repository. You can do that with the following
commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre class=&#39;highlight&#39;&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    $ sudo rm -fr ~/.cocoapods/repos/master
    $ pod setup
    
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE 1:&lt;/strong&gt; If you have any local commits or changes to the Specs repository
which are not merged, you should ensure you have a copy of them. I would
recommend that you manually copy these changes over and re-commit them. You can
fix your repository without deleting, however, this is not a simple process, so
we are instead recommending that you delete your copy of the Specs repository
and any forks of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOTE 2:&lt;/strong&gt; In case you are storing private podspecs in your clone of the
Specs repository or you have a private spec repo that was forked from the
Specs repository, this is a great time to clean that up by using private spec
repositories &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.cocoapods.org/making/private-cocoapods.html&quot;&gt;The Proper Way&lt;/a&gt;. This way your private spec
repository should never be affected by issues in other spec repositories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cocoa Kucha 3 - Berlin - 22nd Jan 2014</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;And just like that the next Cocoa Kucha was declared. As part of a world-wide community 
outreach program I&amp;#39;ve been in talks with &lt;a href=&quot;http://chris.eidhof.nl&quot;&gt;Chris Eidhof&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kurutepe.com&quot;&gt;Engin Kurutepe&lt;/a&gt; 
about running a Cocoa Kucha with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cocoaheads-berlin.github.io&quot;&gt;CocoaHeads Berlin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CocoaPods 0.29</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;em&gt;CocoaPods 0.29 introduces the pod try subcommand, the social media URL
podspec attribute &amp;amp; complete inhibition of header warnings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every now and then we hear about tiny yet huge feature requests for CocoaPods.
Pod try is one of these. Suggested by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lrz&quot;&gt;Laurent Sansonetti&lt;/a&gt;, pod try quickly
gained a spot among the features of CocoaPods that I love the most. But…
What is it?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cocoa Kucha 2 - 16 Jan 2014</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cocoa Kucha is back, this time in London on the 16th of January. I&amp;#39;m excited to
announce that &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/fabiopelosin&quot;&gt;Fabio Pelosin&lt;/a&gt; is going to
make an apperance. Fabio is the biggest contributor to CocoaPods with well
over 3000 commits across the various repositories. Along with Fabio, both
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/orta&quot;&gt;Orta Therox&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/kylefuller&quot;&gt;myself&lt;/a&gt;
will be there. Orta has organised this event, and it&amp;#39;s kindly hosted by
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/daniel1of1&quot;&gt;Daniel Haight&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.meetup.com/NSLondon/&quot;&gt;NSLondon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cool URIs don't change.</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;em&gt;We broke some URIs but this is how we ensure people still get the info they were looking for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To try and simplify where you can find CocoaPods documentation we deprecated &lt;a href=&quot;http://docs.cocoapods.org&quot;&gt;docs.cocoapods.org&lt;/a&gt; in favour of &lt;a href=&quot;http://guides.cocoapods.org&quot;&gt;guides.cocoapods.org&lt;/a&gt; and there will be further subsites with different focuses. To ensure a smooth transition I built a small sinatra app that might be of use to other people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;em&gt;CocoaPods just got a facelift.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe design is important. CocoaPods is probably the most public facing Objective-C project. Applying design to open source projects is a sign of maturity, and of stability. Whilst we&amp;#39;re still not 1.0 yet, having a cohesive brand is a step towards that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post documents some of the work involved in making the new CocoaPods web properties.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CocoaPods 0.28</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;em&gt;CocoaPods 0.28 introduces support for plugins.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting feature creep in CocoaPods is not easy. We hear about a lot of great
ideas and many of them don&amp;#39;t make the cut as they would not be useful for at
least 80% of our users. The ideal solution would be support for third-party
plugins and, luckily, an elegant and lean patch from &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.leshill.org&quot;&gt;Les Hill&lt;/a&gt; has introduced
it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CocoaPods 0.27 and improved installation UX</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: &lt;em&gt;Compilation as part of the CocoaPods gem install process is dead. Long
live precompiled gems!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CocoaPods gems will now be installable &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt;
the need for installing the Xcode Command Line Tools and fixing the Ruby
headers location on OS X (Mountain Lion &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Mavericks).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cocoa Kucha - 20 Nov 2013</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CocoaPods is more than just a tool, CocoaPods is a community of over a thousand &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/graphs/contributors&quot;&gt;commiters&lt;/a&gt;, six thousand Podspecs and hundreds of thousands of &lt;a href=&quot;http://rubygems.org/gems/cocoapods&quot;&gt;users&lt;/a&gt;. To say the community is growing is a mild &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs/graphs/code-frequency&quot;&gt;understatement&lt;/a&gt;. One of the cool things about a big community is that there&amp;#39;s the chance that people will get clumped enough together to make meeting up and sharing ideas a possible. I&amp;#39;d like to announce our first attempt at trying to bring people together, starting in New York City this November.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CocoaPods 0.26</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today we are releasing CocoaPods 0.26.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most visible change is that CocoaPods now hides the schemes of the Pod
targets. If this doesn&amp;#39;t ring a bell the following image should.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CocoaPods is arguably one of the most important open source project in the Objective-C community. It&amp;#39;s used in thousands of applications and has hundreds of thousands of downloads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Building the tool, the community and the ecosystem around the project has happened organically with a mix of people coming and helping out to get us to a position where CocoaPods is essential to any project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting from May 2013, I&amp;#39;ve been working with &lt;a href=&quot;http://andy-myers.co.uk&quot;&gt;Andy Myers&lt;/a&gt; to try and re-think the systems around CocoaPods, ranging from how we do documentation to the branding. This blog post is to open up our process a bit and to explain how we came to some of these ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why we don't accept donations</title>

      <title>Using Acknowledgements</title>

      
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CocoaPods will generate two &amp;#39;Acknowledgements&amp;#39; files for each target specified in your Podfile. If the pods are coming from the master repo, then they must include one. Private pods don&amp;#39;t require one. These contain the License details for each Pod and for most of the part having them in your acknowledgements will be enough to conform to the license.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CocoaPods generates a markdown file for general consumption, as well as a property list file that can be added to a settings bundle for an iOS application. You don&amp;#39;t need to do anything for this to happen, it will just work. If you&amp;#39;d like to know more about extra things you can do with this, read on.&lt;/p&gt;
